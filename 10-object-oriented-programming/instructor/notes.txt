Advantages of OOP

1) Encapsulation
  - Allows us to "classify" concepts

2) Information Hiding
  - States are private by default
  - Access state via behaviours

3) Abstraction
  - The internals of an object is irrelevant to its user

Class

- Blueprint for making instances


Object     |   State                | Behaviour
-----------+------------------------+------------------------
Instance   | Instance Variables (@) | Instance Methods (def)
????       | ????                   | ????
